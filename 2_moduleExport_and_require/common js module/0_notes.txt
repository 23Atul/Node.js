there are two types of module pattern being followed.
1. common js modules (cjs)
2. ES modules (mjs)
----------------------------------------------

COMMON JS MODULES
--> by default used in Node.js
--> uses module.export and require() 
--> older way of doing things

// no need to do this as this json is by default included in node.js
package.json:
{
    "type" : "common"
}
