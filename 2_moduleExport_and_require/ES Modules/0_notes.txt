ES MODULES ( mjs )
--> uses import and export to use files.
--> by default used in React, angular
--> need to implement in node to use it.
--> newer way of doing things
--> to use it we need to make package.json file and include module into it

package.json:
{
    "type" : "module"
}

--> we have an option of Async also.
--> strict mode is by-default ie. even if we miss var,let,const before variable it will throw error.
